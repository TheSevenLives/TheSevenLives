# The Seven Lives
The Seven Lives is a narrative and platformer indie video game, involving in diving into the child’s dreams produced by
her mom telling the tragic history of seven animals. It was initiated by the FLAM group of 2022-2023 twelfth grade NSI
students from Marcel Dassault high school for the NSI Trophy, but is now taken over by the organization
[The Seven Lives](https://github.com/TheSevenLives) created by two students of the previous group and another one that
joined the adventure.
